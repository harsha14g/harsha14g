## 🧐 About Me

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in India, currently working at **Goldman Sachs** in the financial technology domain, where I spend my days ensuring financial systems move faster than a trader on a Monday morning. I specialize in turning 8-second data delays into 1.5-second 'blink-and-you-miss-it' experiences, 'cause in FinTech, nobody has time for a loading spinner. I translate complex business 'wishlists' into clean, scalable Java and React code that runs with zero-downtime.

## 📢 About This GitHub

Think of this profile as a 'Greatest Hits' album, not a code landfill. I’ve intentionally curated these repos to emphasize quality and real-world impact over 'Hello World' volume because after shipping 200+ production enhancements, I’ve learned that quality is the only metric that scales.
